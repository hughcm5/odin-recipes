        <br>1 tablespoon paprika 
        <br>2 teaspoons garlic powder

        <br>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
        <br>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
        <br>1 pork shoulder roast (also called pork butt) 
        <br>4 onions, cut into halves 
        <br>1 bottle good barbecue sauce and good-quality hamburger rolls, for serving
        
    </ul>        
   
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together the brown sugar, chile powder, paprika, garlic powder, salt, black pepper and cayenne in a small bowl. Rub the mixture all over the pork shoulder. Wrap the pork in plastic wrap and refrigerate for several hours or preferably overnight. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Place the pork in a large pot on a bed of the onion halves. Roast until fork-tender and falling apart, about 7 hours. Remove the pork from the pot and set it on a cutting board. Slice some of the onion. </li>
        <li>Place the pot on the stove over medium-high heat and add 1/2 to 1 cup of hot water. Scrape the pan to loosen up the bits and cook for 5 minutes to reduce. Pour in the barbecue sauce and stir to heat. </li>
        <li>Shred the meat with two forks, add the sliced onions to the pork and then toss in the barbecue sauce until it's coated to your liking! Serve on hamburger rolls. </li>
    </ol>
